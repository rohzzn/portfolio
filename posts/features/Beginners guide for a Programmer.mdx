## What is programming?

Before we can introduce you to some key concepts, we need to make sure we understand what programming really is.
A computer is a hardware machine that can store and process information. The language of a computer is Binary, a complex set of ones and zeroes. Programming is essentially the larger-scale process of developing a complex machine program that acts according to our wishes.
Programming is the basic communication between human input and machine output. It is the way that a computer knows how and when to process data.

## So, what is coding, then?

Think of coding as a translator between English (or a different human language) and the computer’s binary. Coding involves the actual syntax and structure by which we write commands. A computer can then take those commands, translate it into binary, and do what is written. Coding involves writing commands in a language that a computer can understand.

## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a formal set of notations and rules. They generate instructions and implement algorithms based on the predetermined rules of that language. A computer can then produce an output from that text.

There are tons of programming languages, and they each serve different purposes, styles, and specializations. Let’s get familiar with the ten most popular programming languages out there.

- Java: this is one of the older, more established programming languages. It is used in universities and large-scale businesses.
- Python: this is a very user-friendly language preferred by many beginners. The syntax is simple and clear, so many newbies get started on Python.
- Ruby: similar to Python, this language is known for being beginner-friendly. It’s easy to read, and it was built on the notion that programming should be fun.
- JavaScript: this is a text-based language for web development. JavaScript is foundational to all websites.
- C: this is one of the original programming languages, so it’s like the parent language. C is known for being hard to learn, but it works great for high-performance applications.
- C++: this language is based on C and adds new features to the old language. It’s also an older one and is known for having a bit of a learning curve. Many universities still teach C++.
- C#: this language, created by Microsoft, is based on C and C++ to make really robust things, like large websites.
- PHP: this is a scripting language that uses HTML to make websites, but it’s taken off for a lot of other uses.
- Swift: this language, developed by Apple, is great for iOS and Mac OS apps. It’s designed similarly to Python and Ruby; it is simple and easy to learn. There is a general push to get more Swift programmers in the field.
- Objective-C: this is an older language that is being slowly replaced by Swift, but it is an important language for the history of software development. It is especially useful for creating applications on Mac OS X and iPhone iOS.

## Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages

A programming language isn’t the only tool necessary for communicating with a computer. After all, the computer “thinks” in binary. Compilers and interpreters take human-readable code and translate it to computer-readable code.

A compiled language means that the machine directly translates the program that you input.

These tend to be faster and more efficient but require an extra “build” step. An interpreted language, however, requires another program to read and execute the code, sort of like a middle-man.

## What is syntax?

Let’s take a deeper look at how you write in a programming language. We will go over the key concepts and vocab terms to get you familiar with coding syntax.

Simply put, the syntax of a computer language is the set of rules that defines the structure of the language. Semantics, on the other hand, refers to logic. Semantics deals with the meaning assigned to the symbols, characters, and words.

So, syntax is structure and form. Semantics is logical meaning.

## Hello World

A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code. It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```
```py
print('Hello, world!')
```
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
```

## Collect the knowledge:

Some employers only require that coders have an associate’s or bachelor’s degree as well as, however, a bachelor’s degree usually results in a higher-paying career with more flexible options for the coders. A bachelor’s or associate’s degree in the field will require courses in computer science, programming, web development, operating systems, database concepts, and computer architecture. In addition to academic work in the university, students also receive hands-on opportunities for learning how to convert code and programming languages.

## Decide your field wisely.

It is really important to decide your career coder and the work field very carefully and on the basis of interest.

There are different types of programming/coding platforms. As well as, When you are figuring out how to learn to program, you need to think carefully about the field you are planning for work in. Some of the most popular types of coders include:-

- Web developers

Web developers can be further separated into front-end and back-end coders. Front-end coders are responsible for writing the code that, how the website looks like and how its content is presented. Back-end programmers are required to write web apps and other complicated programs that provide the framework for the website to run on. In 2019, React Native Web is the most demanding as well as new technology that use to develop the website in very sufficient and creatively, also it is useful to be a top coder.

- Software programmers

Software programmers are the one who develops or creating software for the client/companies on the basis of the demand. But they usually take a design or a concept that would be useful as well as, to be a top coder. It is really important to know what your client needs and what is the purpose of the software. There some programming languages that you should expert in: Java, JavaScript, C++, and Python.

- Mobile app development

It’s easy to use the mobile application even, the demand for exciting new mobile apps also grows. So, mobile app development is quickly becoming one of the most lucrative programming fields, especially if you are good at working on your own. Freelance work is very common for mobile programs. As well as, the best technology to create mobile apps is to React Native that is used to build effective mobile apps. Also, it is easy to learn as well as work on React Native.


## Be friendly with some basic languages:

Once you have settled on a programming field, you need to learn some programming languages that are relevant to your interesting field. For example, learn SQL to become a database administrator as well as CSS, and JavaScript to become a front-end web developer, and something like Java or Swift as well as react native if you love to start building mobile apps.

“Being on the top is not the easy path, you have to learn, fail, stand and success to achieve the top position.”
