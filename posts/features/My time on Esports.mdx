## The Beginning: Falling in Love with Counter-Strike

It all started in 2014 when I first encountered Counter-Strike. From the moment I witnessed its raw and beautiful gameplay, I was hooked. The intricate movement mechanics, the thrilling skin economy, and the vibrant community drew me in like a moth to a flame. At the tender age of 16, the memories this game created for me were truly special, and the people I met through it became some of my closest real-life friends.

Counter-Strike is a game for anyone who can appreciate its raw and beautiful nature, and it quickly became an integral part of my life.

## Taking the Plunge: My First Tournaments

In 2017, I took the plunge and began playing tournaments in my city. Our team secured an impressive 3rd place finish at a fancy 5-star restaurant event conducted by the wonderful people at AMD GameOn. This was the beginning of an annual tradition, as our team was fortunate enough to participate in their tournaments every year.

That same year, we also played at Gamer's Connect by Nvidia, securing another 3rd place finish. The competitive spirit was ignited, and we were hungry for more.

## The Comic-Con Collaboration and Expanding Horizons

From 2018 onwards, Comic-Con collaborated with AMD GameOn, and they started conducting the tournaments together. Our team's hard work paid off as we secured 2nd place in both 2018 and 2019. Determined to expand my horizons, I also ventured into PUBG in 2019, where I earned an impressive 2nd place. However, my skills in Fortnite left much to be desired.

## The Pandemic and Online Transition

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, AMD GameOn shut down, and we transitioned to playing online games. That year, Act, a WiFi company, conducted an online CSGO 1v1 tournament, and without a team to hold me back, I secured 1st place. This was a testament to my individual skills and determination.

The pandemic also brought about the rise of Valorant, and I was fortunate enough to gain access to the beta. After a couple of months of dedicated grinding, I reached the coveted Immortal rank. This opened up new opportunities, as I had the chance to play at the NIIT college fest with a few friends, earning 2nd place in both 2020 and 2021.

## The Return to LAN

In 2020, our team, Trinity Gaming, secured 1st place at the TAGVALO tournament, where we had the honor of defeating the YouTuber SnaxGaming. This was a significant milestone in our esports journey and a testament to our teamwork and dedication.

Finally, in 2024, after a long break, we proved that our skills were still sharp as we became the Valorant runners-up at the Comic-Con x AMD GameOn x The Arena event. This achievement filled me with immense pride and reminded me of the incredible journey I had embarked upon.
